# Capstone Project - Wholesaler on Fresh Flowers

Fresh Flowers is a wholesaler based in Brisbane. The main focus was to discover the customer lifetime value to the business. The customer lifetime value model was built using the python lifetime library package. The RFM matrix was created to visualise customers repeat purchases and behaviours. The project was successful as I was able to predict customers future purchases based on the history.
